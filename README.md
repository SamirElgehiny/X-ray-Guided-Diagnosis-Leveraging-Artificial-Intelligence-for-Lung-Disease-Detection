# X-ray-Guided Diagnosis: Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for Lung Disease Detection

![Project Logo/Image]

## Overview

Welcome to the "X-ray-Guided Diagnosis" GitHub repository! This project is an Advanced Data Science Capstone, developed in collaboration with IBM. The primary goal of this project is to leverage artificial intelligence for the detection of lung diseases using X-ray images. The solution employs advanced data science techniques, including architectural choices, data quality assessment, and model performance evaluation.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **/data:** [Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alsaniipe/chest-x-ray-image)
- **/notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks documenting various stages of the project, including data exploration, model development, and evaluation.
  - **CombinedCCT.ipynb:** Notebook containing the code for the Compacted Convolutional Transformer (CCT) model.
  - **aug.ipynb:** Notebook focusing on data augmentation techniques.
